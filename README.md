# My Cool Keyswitch & Related Library (MCKRL) üêü

This repository contains KiCad footprint library generators. See the releases tab for a downloadable archive of footprints!

## Usage

Requires `uv`.

Run `uv sync`, source the virtualenv, then `mckrl`. The footprints will appear in a `generated/` directory.

See `mckrl --help` for options.

## History

This was originally built and maintained by Cutie Club for internal usage and was known as cutie-lib.

## Next major release:

- Box sizing will be updated to support creating keyswitch footprints from multiple squares, this allows for ISO style caps
